## About
I am a physics graduate currently teaching at college level and systematically preparing for PhD applications in **Computational Physics**.

This GitHub documents my learning and projects in:
- Numerical methods for physics
- Computational modeling and simulation
- Scientific Python

I am building a strong foundation in computation alongside physics.

## Portfolio Projects

[Projectile Motion: From Vacuum to Quadratic Drag](https://github.com/rcgiri-physics/rcgiri-physics/tree/main/projectile-simulation)

This project examines the transition from ideal motion to non-linear systems using numerical integration.

Core Technique: Implementation of the Euler Method for time-evolution.

Physics Covered: Comparative analysis of Vacuum, Linear (Stokes), and Quadratic (Newton) drag models.

Validation: Numerical results were verified against analytical solutions for linear drag.
