## About

I am a physics graduate currently teaching at college level and systematically preparing for PhD applications in **Computational Physics**.

This GitHub documents my learning and projects in:

- Numerical methods for physics
- Computational modeling and simulation
- Scientific Python

I am building a strong foundation in computation alongside physics.

## Current Focus

- Python for scientific computing
- Numerical solutions of physical systems
- Physics-inspired simulation projects

## Portfolio Projects

[Projectile Motion: From Vacuum to Quadratic Drag](https://github.com/rcgiri-physics/projectile-simulation)
A research-validated study on dissipative systems using high-order numerical integration.

Version 2.1 Milestone: Implemented a Numerical Audit & Residual Analysis framework.

Validation: Cross-verified the custom engine against the industry-standard scipy.integrate.solve_ivp (RK45) benchmark.

Precision: Achieved 99.98% accuracy with a maximum vertical deviation of $\approx 5.31 \times 10^{-3}$ meters over non-linear trajectories.

Architecture: Utilized a vectorized state-space representation in NumPy, optimizing for $O(\Delta t^4)$ global error scaling.
