## About

I am a physics graduate currently teaching at college level and systematically preparing for PhD applications in **Computational Physics**.

This GitHub documents my learning and projects in:

- Numerical methods for physics
- Computational modeling and simulation
- Scientific Python

I am building a strong foundation in computation alongside physics.

## Current Focus

- Python for scientific computing
- Numerical solutions of physical systems
- Physics-inspired simulation projects

## Portfolio Projects

[Projectile Motion: From Vacuum to Quadratic Drag](https://github.com/rcgiri-physics/projectile-simulation)

This project examines the transition from ideal motion to non-linear systems using numerical integration.

Version 2.0 Achievement: Implemented a 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) engine.

Architecture: Shifted to a vectorized state-space representation using NumPy, reducing global error scaling to $O(\Delta t^4)$.

Validation: Conducted stability checks comparing Euler drift against RK4 precision at large time-steps.
